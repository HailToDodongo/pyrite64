Assets
====================================

| This page focuses on assets you can use with Pyrite64,
| including tools, settings and limitations.

| Note that in general, the assets you put in the ``assets`` directory are never used 1:1 at runtime.
| All of them are processed into optimized files during build.
| On the following pages those are called "source" and "runtime" assets respectively.


| Below are all currently supported asset types, and their details:
